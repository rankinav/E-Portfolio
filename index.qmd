Hi, I'm Aidan. Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biodiversity and Conservation Biology at the University of Toronto in 2023 with minors in GIS and philosophy. I then moved to Vancouver, BC, to expand my knowledge and skills in geomatics and remote sensing in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management program at the University of British Columbia. My focus during this graduate degree has been applications of remotely sensed data for animal conservation on campus.
