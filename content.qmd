# Modelling ecological connectivity on the UBC campus

Capstone project for the MGEM program. This project involved classifying land cover at the University of British Columbia Vancouver campus and then modelling animal and human movement across the landscape to identify points of potential conflict and potential corridors to promote coexistence.

## Classified land cover

Sample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page [here](https://ubc-mgem-fcor599.github.io/FCOR-599-Workshops/Interactive_Maps/leaflet.html).

```{r leaflet, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr); library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") %>%
  addScaleBar(position = c("bottomleft")) %>%
  setView(-123.1207, 49.2827, zoom = 11)

```

```{r map, echo=FALSE}
m
```

## Additional code

Python Arcpy cursor used to generate building capacity numbers based on building code limits to estimate human presence numbers within each building on campus.

``` python
##checks if there is already a field for building capacity created
if "capacity" not in [f.name for f in arcpy.ListFields("buildings_clipped")]:
  
    ##creates new field in attribute table
    arcpy.management.AddField(in_table="buildings_clipped",
                              field_name="capacity", 
                              field_type="FLOAT")

##creating update cursor for buildings_clipped feature, looking at four specific fields
with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor("buildings_clipped", field_names=["Shape_Area", "bldg_usage", "max_floors", "capacity"]) as cursor:
  
    ##for every row, if the row has a building area value, then the building max capacity is added to the new field
    for row in cursor:
      
        if row[0] is not None:
            ##max capacity is building area * number of floors * 0.4 people per m^2
            row[3] = row[0] * row[2] * 0.4 
        else:
            pass

        cursor.updateRow(row)
```

# Urban ecology: stream temperature as a function of impermeable land cover

## Abstract:

Increased impermeable surface cover increases runoff and temperatures in urban streams with ecological implications. Analysis of impermeable surface area at sites in Toronto region watersheds was carried out to test the relevance of this relationship. Surface impermeability is correlated with mean stream temperature at large scales, but minimum and maximum temperatures display no relationship. This may be due to the homogeneous urban landscape, the impact of cool water entering upstream at headwaters, or other physical characteristics of urban streams.

## Results:
