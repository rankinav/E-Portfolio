Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biodiversity and Conservation Biology at the University of Toronto in 2023 with minors in GIS and philosophy. I then moved to Vancouver, BC, to expand my knowledge and skills in geomatics and remote sensing in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management program at the University of British Columbia. My focus during this graduate degree has been applications of remotely sensed data for animal conservation on campus."

    "text": "Capstone project for the MGEM program. This project involved classifying land cover at the University of British Columbia Vancouver campus and then modelling animal and human movement across the landscape to identify points of potential conflict and potential corridors to promote coexistence.\n\n\n\nLand cover on campus was classified using random forests in Python, from Planet SkySat satellite imagery and Vancouver public LiDAR.\n\nThe most important features in training the random forests classifier were the normalized difference vegetation index, a measure of vegetation derived from the red and near-infrared bands of the imagery, and the digital surface model, an elevation model of surface features derived from LiDAR.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the classified land cover map, human pedestrian and wildlife connectivity models were run and typical connectivity maps were created. Above is the mean connectivity values per 0.5x0.5 metre cell, calculated from combining connectivity model outputs for five different test species. Species resistance values per land cover class were reclassified according to the table below, where each value represents the relative resistance or difficulty each species has in moving through a cell of the associated land cover type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nForest\nLow veg\nGrass\nBarren\nWater\nArtificial turf\nAsphalt\nBuilding\nShadow\n\n\n\n\nHuman pedestrian\n60\n70\n20\n20\n100\n30\n1\n30\n15\n\n\nPacific treefrog\n10\n10\n30\n30\n1\n50\n70\n100\n85\n\n\nLittle brown bat\n1\n1\n10\n1\n1\n60\n80\n60\n70\n\n\nBand-tailed pigeon\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n30\n30\n80\n65\n\n\nGrey squirrel\n1\n10\n10\n10\n100\n30\n50\n90\n70\n\n\nCoyote\n10\n10\n10\n10\n100\n60\n30\n100\n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython Arcpy cursor used to generate building capacity numbers based on building code limits to estimate human presence numbers within each building on campus.\n##checks if there is already a field for building capacity created\nif \"capacity\" not in [f.name for f in arcpy.ListFields(\"buildings_clipped\")]:\n  \n    ##creates new field in attribute table\n    arcpy.management.AddField(in_table=\"buildings_clipped\",\n                              field_name=\"capacity\", \n                              field_type=\"FLOAT\")\n\n##creating update cursor for buildings_clipped feature, looking at four specific fields\nwith arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(\"buildings_clipped\", field_names=[\"Shape_Area\", \"bldg_usage\", \"max_floors\", \"capacity\"]) as cursor:\n  \n    ##for every row, if the row has a building area value, then the building max capacity is added to the new field\n    for row in cursor:\n        if row[0] is not None:\n            ##max capacity is building area * number of floors * 0.4 people per m^2\n            row[3] = row[0] * row[2] * 0.4 \n        else:\n            pass\n        cursor.updateRow(row)\nConfiguration file for running Omniscape connectivity model in Julia, with coyote species-specific parameters.\nresistance_file = C:/Users/ranki/Documents/Grad/FCOR599/campus_resample_v2.tif\nradius = 100\nblock_size = 21\nproject_name = C:/Users/ranki/Documents/Grad/FCOR599/coyote_config/coyote_test\n\nsource_from_resistance = true\nr_cutoff = 30\nreclassify_resistance = true\nreclass_table = C:/Users/ranki/Documents/Grad/FCOR599/coyote_config/coyote_reclass_table.txt\ncalc_normalized_current = true\n\nprecision = single\nsolver = cholmod"
