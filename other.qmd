# Urban ecology: stream temperature as a function of impermeable land cover

## Abstract:

Increased impermeable surface cover increases runoff and temperatures in urban streams with ecological implications. Analysis of impermeable surface area at sites in Toronto region watersheds was carried out to test the relevance of this relationship. Surface impermeability is correlated with mean stream temperature at large scales, but minimum and maximum temperatures display no relationship. This may be due to the homogeneous urban landscape, the impact of cool water entering upstream at headwaters, or other physical characteristics of urban streams.

## Results:

Data was accessed from open-source repositories maintained by the Toronto Region Conservation Authority and the Province of Ontario Geohub.
