# Urban ecology: stream temperature as a function of impermeable land cover

An undergraduate project completed for a fourth-year urban ecology course, and a rare opportunity I took to combine my interests and incorporate GIS skills in an ecology project.

## Abstract:

Increased impermeable surface cover increases runoff and temperatures in urban streams with ecological implications. Analysis of impermeable surface area at sites in Toronto region watersheds was carried out to test the relevance of this relationship. Surface impermeability is correlated with mean stream temperature at large scales, but minimum and maximum temperatures display no relationship. This may be due to the homogeneous urban landscape, the impact of cool water entering upstream at headwaters, or other physical characteristics of urban streams.

## Results:

Data was accessed from open-source repositories maintained by the Toronto Region Conservation Authority and the Province of Ontario Geohub.

Tenuous correlation between percent impermeable cover within two buffer areas around a stream data collection site, and stream temperature.

# Historical GIS data curation and digitization

Before MGEM, I was working at the University of Toronto's Map and Data Library as a GIS assistant, mostly on historical projects where I digitized features, and georeferenced scanned historical paper maps.

## Lost Rivers of Toronto

A project mapping historical lost and buried rivers in Toronto. I contributed digitized rivers from early 20th century historical maps and edited existing layers based on potential stream locations from elevation.

## Southern Ontario historical maps

A project mapping historical road networks across Southern Ontario. I contributed digitized lines and managed and digitized attributes.

## Historical York County, 1923

A georeferenced historical map of York County, Ontario, digitized from the University of Toronto Map and Data Library collection.

# Other web maps

Other web mapping applications I have worked on include:

## Local green space in my neighbourhood in Toronto

A story map on the use and development projects occuring within a small green space I was very familiar with at the time, incorporating map elements I digitized and photos I took myself.

## Bicycle rack locations and reported bicycle thefts in Toronto.

An instant app created for a course project, exploring scale-responsive data visualization.
